# AllegiantCodeChallenge
A Code Challenge for prosepective Allegiant Employees

You will find in this repository several classes relating to a new set of inventory items that
Allegiant needs to manage in its warehouses called widgets and Sprockets. A 
Widget is a container for sprockets, each of which has an id, color and price.
We have written the base classes for Sprockets and Widgets. Your job is to 
fill in the code for the methods in the WidgetManager and WidgetReader class and write unit tests 
for those methods.
